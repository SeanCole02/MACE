<b>MACE</b> is a goal-oriented autonomous AI system that aims to abstract and implement a high-level of modularity for continuous coding to achieve user-defined goals and accelerate development workflows.

## ðŸ¤– Getting Started
Alter the config file found in `/config_files/config.cfg`.<br>

Launch the MACE server.

Launch the MACE client once the server has started.

Set goals for the AI to achieve by specifying the desired outcomes and conditions (example provided in config file).

Each output will be saved in `/iterations`.

Start the MACE engine and let it autonomously execute code to reach the defined goals.<br>
